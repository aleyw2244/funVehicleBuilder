# funVehicleBuilder
For anyone interested in vehicles

This code is a vehicle builder that contains many different files. It is a demonstration of what we learned about Typescript and OOP. It is quite detailed and multilayered but as you look through it, you'll find it very interesting. 

This repo has a singular commit as the work was done by a single individual on one local device so changes were made locally before sending the final product up to Github.

There were many classes used but this task mainly focused on building up the Truck and Motorbike classes.

Here is a walkthrough video of the vehicle builder for your viewing pleasure:
